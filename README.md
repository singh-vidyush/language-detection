This machine learning model is fit for beginner to practice.
-----------
As a person, it's effortless to recognize the languages you are familiar with. For instance, I can readily distinguish between Hindi and English. However, as an Indian, it's challenging for me to identify all the diverse languages spoken in India. This is where the task of language identification becomes valuable. Google Translate stands out as one of the most widely used language translation tools globally, catering to a vast user base. It incorporates a machine learning model to identify languages, providing a solution for those unsure about the language they wish to translate.
-----------
The pivotal aspect in crafting an effective language detection model lies in the abundance of data. The greater the volume of data available for each language, the more precise the real-time performance of your model becomes. The dataset I'm utilizing has been sourced from Kaggle, encompassing information on 22 widely spoken languages, with 1000 sentences for each language. This dataset proves to be fitting for training a language detection model through machine learning. In the subsequent section, I will guide you through the process of training a language detection model using Python.
